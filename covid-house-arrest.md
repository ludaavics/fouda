It is a sweet burden to be British\
English or Scot\
All your subjects think you are wrong\
But you know you are bloody right\
A bridge must be built over the river Kwai\
Dissenters are jailed for no reason\
It is house arrest for all natives\
Habeas corpus is not for Zulus\
From afar an alien watches and learns\
It is global house arrest as Covid-19 strikes\
Avaricious like all invaders\
Demands we pay for our own jail time\
It is house arrest at our own cost indeed\
Working from home saves a lot of time\
Office politics is overrated\
Home politics is so complicated\
Vacuuming is a form of exercise\
Gardening seems reasonable at last\
Yelling on the phone is low risk now\
Fall is actually enjoyable in Boston\
There is no excuse for not exercising\
Cardio is accessible at almost no cost\
Walking is always an option for grocery\
Let your teenagers shop for you\
You have earned it nothing more to say\
Your kids can curse like drunken sailors\
They are on the right path to adulthood\
No need to greet masked forms in hoodies\
Elevators are awful places in Boston\
No one misses watching their faux ceilings\
We like our families\
No comment on love I am still a quant
