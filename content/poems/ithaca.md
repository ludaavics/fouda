Since you are leaving today\
Since this cradle could not yield to your cravings\
Since your heart is throbbing in Ithaca\
Since it could never beat peacefully here \
Since you are looking for warmer suns\
Since you are leaving today\
I realize that you tire from always being on alert\
That despair can be stronger than love \
That staying is to be complicit \
That exit is a form of speech\
That crying is sterile now\
Since you are leaving today\
Weep no more your failures in rigged battles\
Instead carry with you delightful memories \
about your everyday victories\
You did not utter a word until age four\
Yet were a graduation class speaker \
You are so strong now it rattles \
Since you are leaving today\
Remember the perverse pleasure of stealing \
Fruits from our orchards belonging to them\
Sweet revenge of knowledge over power \
The spicy gumbo after Sunday service\
Family picnics at Negro Creek’s bank\
Chatoyant ripples of a pond at dusk\
Recall this if you are sad in Ithaca\
Since you are leaving today\
I am sure you will find work shoveling snow\
Your fingers will hurt under thick mittens\
Sidewalks are slippery in November\
Be careful how you move around\
It is already winter over Ithaca\
Since you are leaving today\
Taste everything you were not allowed here\
Beyond Ithaca is Canada\
You will settle at the frontier \
No more land to conquer\
Except the vast expanse lying within you
