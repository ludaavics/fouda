God does not die \
so, I cannot die.\
I am made in his image,\
so, I will endure my cruel fate--\
my eternal homage. \
God does not perish \
so, I cannot perish. \
I know I will survive your greed,\
there is doubt in your furtive gaze;\
you are haunted by your avarice.\
God does not die\
so why would I die?\
I warn you of the deceptive glitter\
fluttering around the world forever.\
You can gain from my body with violence,\
but my soul is evidence\
that God does not perish,\
so never can I.
