Since time is the substitute for God \
Since time blazes our paths\
Since time has come for you to leave \
Since you have decided to run after the sun\
Since California is where your heart will beat\
We understand one day backward or forward\
You will be back home if only for a quick hug\
But as you work with time of your own\
Remember that you will never walk alone \
Remember to be happy in small victories \
Remember to share credit and alleviate blame\
Remember your mother in each woman \
Remember each man is in your own image \
We will miss your mess downstairs and upstairs\
We will remember with a chuckle your small lies\
Proud you fought\
For your ticket to run after the sun \
Your room already a museum \
A slip through time
