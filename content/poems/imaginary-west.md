The West is dead \
No more unsettled lands \
Expendable hands \
Seek no glory in foreign wars \
Skin crumbles with too many scars \
Imaginary homelands await the well-armed \
Deep in your brain lie American dreams \
Of education turned to golden streams \
All that is forbidden is permitted \
Inequality constitutionally mandated \
The west is indefinitely dead \
Soon the imaginary country lifts its head
