You call it with reverence law enforcement. \
I experience it as violation of my body,

defiled with unjustified force, \
rules divide into castes.

I am the untouchable, \
ignored by the Constitution, codex of this land.

A phantom system grades humans \
incidental or consequential.

Someday, \
my body, the sacred vessel of my life,

will be sanctified in law and custom, \
insured of common ascent.
