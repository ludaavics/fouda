I spend the night\
holding myself tight\
texting you\
to say I love you\
My impulse folly\
a spring fever\
I strive to be holy\
There is no peace in the negation of passion\
Nor in the discomfort of transgression\
Pain is the true cost of love\
fate an eternal pyre\
I hope your memory\
Will balm my flesh on fire
