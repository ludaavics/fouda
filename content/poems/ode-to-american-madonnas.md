They are the Black Madonnas \
Housed in churches of Europe, \
Incandescent shrines \
Where pilgrims burn away bothering sins, \
Repair broken bodied souls. \

The dark statues channel miracles \
From Mary and her son \
Sacrificed so that they can see light \
In the New World. \

Echoes of the risen are not confined in shrines \
They are flesh, blood, bones and tears, \
Dark skinned priestesses carrying spears, \
Whose sons have been taken away. \

Black Madonnas atone for our lapses. \
They cook breakfast then pluck cocks, \
Iron bedsheets, stitch socks. \

With open eyes they steal reading, \
Charcoal in hand they learn writing, \
Disguised in men lead captives to freedom, \
Eyes focused on a just kingdom. \
