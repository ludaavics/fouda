Five birds, radiant like rainbows\
under December sun.\
The evergreens, their usual color,\
the lawn still green,\
lingering against winter pallor.\
But suddenly dark clouds. \
A northeaster restoring order.\
The birds take their hullabaloo into a bush,\
sing through the storm until death,\
The birds are me,\
caught in a storm,\
dreaming of a distant sunny kingdomâ€”\
only songs sustain their longing.
