Every evening \
when sun’s dying rays set low\
my flushed mind flies over the ocean,\
straining even more a body bruised,\
by much sweat and more tears. \
Repairing slumber must wait.\
I am unable to wish away memories, \
no force can erase histories,\
tales of my cruel fate. \
Every evening \
I sneak back to my village at dusk\
watch from afar—a mere onlooker. \
Women drift back from the river\
heads adorned with fractal tresses,\
scalps shining with fresh shea butter.\
Voices break the thud of crickets, \
I need to know their song, \
laugh at the world with them.\
Every evening\
shaping the past for the future \
old women and men \
tell tales, pipes alight around campfires,\
children enthralled by each epic meeting.\
Clay pots simmer on wood fires \
with a promise of a feast.\
I rush through my dream before it expires, \
as a drummer broadcasts his first measure.\
Every evening\
I am a living ghost\
easily ignored, \
dreams just an evasion\
from my salvation.\
Why endure such existence; \
to hear and not be heard,\
to see and not be seen,\
to love without feedback? \
I remember but they will never know\
I am singing the blues, head in a bow,\
my only plea swinging back,\
the fatal womb of my exclusion.\
Each time I must hug my mother,\
it is my evening prayer.
