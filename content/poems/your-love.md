Your love is endless \
a river under full moon, \
meandering lazily,\
at times noisily,\
but in motion always...\
When the stream strikes rock\
it sings from the shock,\
a lullaby repeated \
a music recycled \
but fresh always...\
When it is dark\
and I cannot see your love, \
I take comfort \
in the riverâ€™s waves recurring, \
even as they break always...
