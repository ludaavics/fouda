I remember you \
Emerald Island \

Happy Taino frolicking on golden beaches \
Columbus spread European strains \

Taino villages depleted as old mines \
Unwilling Africans captives in absurd plans \

I remember the chant \
God does not die so we cannot die \

Fairy tales last only in books \
Liberté Égalité Fraternité are conditional \

Haiti learns \
Hard currency paid to France \

The emerald island has no more trees \
Poverty still kills the land \
