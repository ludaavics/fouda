Shadows are adaptable\
Short then long\
Burly then tall\
Bold when there is light\
Discreet at night\
Never unfaithful\
Makeshift sundials\
Know the time\
Winter breakfast\
Summer late meal\
Shadows like old friends\
follow you fast\
If you cannot see yours\
You are in\
dangerous denial\
It is time to look for a friend
