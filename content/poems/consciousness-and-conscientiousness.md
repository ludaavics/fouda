This poem, if conscious, would thank me \
for the gift of awareness. \
Consciousness is extraordinary. \

I will never presume to get this poem fully. \
I will write other poems, \
So this poem never walks alone. \

That is why I am here, \
To validate joys, \
To validate pains. \

Only I understand. \
Free and conscious, \
I honor this gift with hope.
