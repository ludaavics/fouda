Time runs\
Toward uncertain futures.\
I wish to savor its delightful slices.\
Each day at this time I look forward\
To your love,\
happily watching the clock.

Suddenly you are gone, taken by time.\
Memories turned regrets, the only token of your presence--\
Now you are moments of my heart.\
I do not wish time to stop like it did for Pompei\
Gone with no witness.\
How much were they loved?
