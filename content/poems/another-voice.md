Silence is a note\
a word unsaid\
filling the instant\
Close and so remote at once:\
Anger in a black hole,\
Calm over a volcano,\
Unbearable tension of love withheld.\
No word from paralyzed and heavy lips\
without a lisp\
My saxophone\
wails so beautifully I cannot compete\
Drum’s explosion relays turmoil\
Cello calm vibration says I love you\
Listen to the notes more than the words\
They will carry you where I’ve hidden\
my voice.
