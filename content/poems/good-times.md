We used to eat cake\
after a stranger has blown on it.\
Now so many are left alone,\
innocence undone.\
We converse in muffled voices,\
words broken by security masks.\
This will come to pass.\
We will find a way to atone\
or fail towards Antarctica, \
where penguins wait in tuxedos.\
We are lost ships on international waters,\
in pursuit of \
good times.
