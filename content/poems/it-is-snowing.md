Snow is all around,\
the neighborhood under a shroud,\
thermometers settle at their lows.

Skin so cold it burns,\
your brain tells you hedge at all costs.\
Light a fire if you know what a match is.

Maybe call your landlord for help.\
Otherwise, wear your wardrobe,\
I mean all the pieces at once.

It is Boston, after all:\
This will be long.
