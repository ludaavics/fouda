We are consigned to hoods \
The only home we know, \
Beatdown, true, familiar.

Grandmothers sit near windows, \
Watch over their lively broods, \
Over basketball games on parking yards,

Pickup baseball set on back alleys, \
Until some window shatters-- \
This is where we live and die.

Sunday mornings streets turn quiet \
The reverend delivers gospel to \
Men on their best behavior \
And aunts in their best Sunday hats \
The church is where all are taxed.

Children bundled up Monday to Friday \
In yellow buses heading to the highway \
Their parents apprehensive but hopeful \
Exile in Babylon helps to reveal books, \
Demystifies the minds behind the masks.
