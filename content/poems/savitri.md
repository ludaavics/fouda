There are flowers\
that need no showers\
to glow at night, \
shine in the light.

They discovered a way,\
expectations cast away,\
similar to pearls\
the mythological girl\
won her husband’s breath \
outthinking the god of death.

Resourceful and determined,\
you seem predestined \
to be happy \
as much as one can be.\
The price of peace\
is that inequities cease
