He wants to eat gumbo,\
but is served a Mac Jumbo,\
slowly losing his sense of taste,\
a natural gift taken away. \
He is denied every small pleasure,\
unable to imagine any future; \
blamed without proof \
he carries on with his dreams.\
But how to sort out so many streams?

We want more they say in unison,\
code for lock him up in prison.\
The beast is fed in wretched lives.\
It started with Africans in chains,\
Black slaves in plantations, \
Negros in chain gangs.\
Now marginals are corralled in compounds,\
freedoms traded for the profit of few,\
for a wall around the land,\
to jail all who cannot fly.
