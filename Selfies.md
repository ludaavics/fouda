Selfies\
broadcast intrusive wrinkles\
the ones that rankle\
that you want hidden\
even from your children--\
unsteady hands\
have ruined many brands\
Look into your own eyes\
collapsing into a blind spot.\
Why donâ€™t you give some work\
to the stranger seeking your eyes?\
He will find the right distance\
to capture your bright gaze.\
Contortions end up in knots\
like feedback for a greener pasture.\
Get a clean image including blind spots.\
You need some distance for the full picture.
