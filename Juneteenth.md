Long ago, wisemen\
summoned a gift from haven,\
sacred scriptures often misunderstood,\
and kids were born in bondage\
flowers were deemed rotten food.

After years spent in quiet rage\
a prophet reads the holy texts anew\
licenses all to freelance. 

The road is windy that brings\
good news to Galveston.\
Let us sing.\
Let us dance.
